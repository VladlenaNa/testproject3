                You! Since starting this project in 2008, we've been lucky
                enough to have users just like you add and edit
                missing/incorrect data. Think of TMDB as a very specialised
                version of Wikipedia where everything is editable but very
                specialised around only movie, TV and actor data. We started
                with an initial data contribution from a project called omdb
                with only 10,000 movies in 2009. Everything added and edited
                since then has been users just like you! In October 2013, we
                finally added TV. Since we didn't want to start with an empty
                database we opted to bring an intial import of data from
                Freebase. Unfortunately, Freebase is no longer online and was
                shut down in 2016.
